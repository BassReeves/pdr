Professor Bloomfield's Fall 2020 lectures
=========================================

[Go up to the lectures page](../index.html) ([md](../index.md))

The code linked to on this page is what was discussed during the lecture periods in the fall of 2020 in Professor Bloomfield's 1:00pm - 1:50pm lecture periods.  Note that the code herein is what was the state at the end of that lectur period; the development of the code helped explain the concepts, and that can be found in the lecture recordings.  Thus, there are no comments included in the files.  Any images that were sketched on [sketch.io](https://sketch.io/sketchpad/) are included as well.

Unless stated otherwise in the code comments, all code is compiled with `clang++ *.cpp`.  However, a few of the lecture files have mutiple programs, and each one will have to be compiled separately (`clang++ <file1>.cpp`, `clang++ <file2>.cpp`, etc.).
